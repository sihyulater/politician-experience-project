# politician-experience-project

This repo is dedicated to code related to Professor Malmendier's Politician Experience Project. These codes are for tracking the location history of the politicians.

## Data source
The `BioguideProfiles` folder was downloaded from [Biography Directory of the United States](https://bioguide.congress.gov/).

The `H102_votes.csv`, `HSall_members.csv`, `HSall_votes.csv` were all downloaded from [Voteview.com](https://www.voteview.com/data) 

## Code

* `01 Generating Bios File.ipynb`: takes in all the bioguide `json` files under `BioguideProfiles`, and outputs `results/bioguide.csv`, which contains all information from the json files.
* `02 Parse birth Places and School.ipynb`: takes in `results/bioguide.csv`, and outputs `results/bioguide_birth_places_schools.csv` which contains appended birth places and school columns.
* `03 Geocoding Birthplaces with Google Maps.ipynb`: takes in `results/bioguide_birth_places_schools.csv` and outputs `results/geocoded_birthplaces.csv`, which added the latitudes and longitudes of the birthplaces. Additionally, to compare the results from the old codes in 2018, this file also takes in `tables2018/current_legislators_birth_places_schools.csv` and `tables2018/historical_legislators_birth_places_schools.csv`, and outputs comparison table `result/comparison.csv`.
* `04 Extracting Places and Years.ipynb`: takes in `results/bioguide.csv` and `prompt.txt`, and outputs `results/sample_tables.txt`, which contains 3 sample tables of time and location generated by ChatGPT.

## Archives
* `finetune_dataprep.ipynb`: takes in `samplebios.`, and manually generates the tables of time and location for 10 random sample bios for finetuning the model. (not used)
