# politician-experience-project

This repo is dedicated to code related to Professor Malmendier's Politician Experience Project.

## Code

* `Generating Bios File.ipynb`: takes in the bioguide `.json` files and generates a `csv` file containing infos for the legislators
* `Parse birth Places and School.ipynb`: takes in the `.csv` bios of the legislator and outputs a file with appended birth places and school columns.
* `Geocoding Birthplaces with Google Maps`: takes in birthplaces and outputs the latitudes and longitudes of the county to which they belong.
