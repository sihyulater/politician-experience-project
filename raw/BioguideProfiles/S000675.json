Also of interest are the Floor Statements, Remarks, and Extensions made by Solomon. Solomon kept most of the House Resolutions voted on during the later half of his career, which are represented in the collection. The papers lack substantive correspondence and material related to his early congressional career (1978-1988). He also served as a member of the New York State Assembly from 1973-1978.","recordLocation":{"name":"M.E.
