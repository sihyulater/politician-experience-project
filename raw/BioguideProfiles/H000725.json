In that race, Hollings was opposed by Republican and former United States Congressman Tommy Hartnett. Hollings seat had been targeted by the Republican Party as vulnerable and, indeed, the race proved to be one of the closest in Hollings’ history. He won reelection with 50.07% of the vote. In the interview, Brack talks at length about the campaign and his role as spokesman, and his estimate of the Hartnett campaign. Oral History Transcript, Michael Copps (pdf, 33 pages) Dr. Copps worked for Hollings as a special research assistant, executive assistant, and Administrative Assistant, 1970-1985. Copps reflects on Hollings' work habits and character, provides astute descriptions of the inner workings of the Hollings Office, and comments on Hollings' impact on the debate over the SALT treaties, the Carter administration's passage of the Panama Canal treaties, and Hollings' 1984 Presidential campaign and decision to shift from the Budget Committee to Commerce. Oral History Transcript, Walter Harper (pdf, 36 pages) Gov. Hollings campaigned in 1958 on a promise to improve the state's economic climate. Soon after taking office, he expanded the SC Development Board membership and brought Walter Harper on as Director to plan, organize, and help lead an energetic development effort aimed at expanding current manufacturing enterprises, bringing new industry to SC, and promoting tourism. Harper had been engaged in development work in NC under Gov. Luther Hodges. In this 1997 interview, Harper reflects on his leadership of the Development Board, 1959-1967. Oral History Transcript, Mary Winton Hughes (pdf, 41 pages) Hughes reflects on her career as a Senate staff member in the office of Fritz Hollings in this 1993 interview. She started in his office in 1969. Oral History Transcript, Karen Kollmansperger (pdf, 29 pages) In this 1993 interview, Kollmansperger reflects on her experiences in Washington, D.C., chiefly while working as a Senate staff member in the office of Fritz Hollings. She started in his office in 1967. Oral History Transcript, Joe Maupin (pdf, 40 pages) Maupin was Hollings' Charleston Area Director. In this 1999 interview, he reflects on his service directing the Low Country operations of the office, beginning in 1978. Oral History Transcript, Bernard B. \"Bubba\" Meng (pdf, 21 pages) Meng graduated from USC and initially became involved in South Carolina politics through his friendship with fellow student Liz Johnston, daughter of US Senator Olin D. Johnston. Meng worked for Johnston in Washington in the early 1960s, later joined Hollings' 1966 Senate campaign staff, and stayed on with Hollings as his Home Secretary until his retirement in 1989. Oral History Transcript, Martha Payne (pdf, 23 pages) Payne worked for Hollings first while he served as Governor of South Carolina and rejoined his staff shortly after his election to the U.S. Senate. Her work in the Senator's Columbia office chiefly entailed constituent service work. Payne gave this interview upon her retirement in 1995. Oral History Transcript, James Madison Waddell, Jr. (pdf, 22 pages) Former state senator Waddell of Beaufort, South Carolina, reflects on state government, his service in the General Assembly as a member of the House, 1955-1958, and Senate, 1961-1993, and involvement in the campaigns of Fritz Hollings, 1960 and 1966, and John West in 1970. Oral History Transcript, Harry Walker (pdf, 29 pages) Walker served as Hollings' legal assistant, 1959-1963. He was responsible for all legal matters that reached the Governor's office, advised Hollings on the constitutionality of bills sent for his signature, oversaw statewide appointments and those requiring Senat e confirmation, and served as disaster coordinator for the state and as liaison with all law enforcement. This latter capacity proved particularly challenging, as Walker worked closely with SLED chief Pete Strom to ensure the peace during this watershed period of civil rights activities.","recordLocation":{"name":"South Carolina Political Collections","location":{"addressLocality":"Columbia","addressRegion":"SC"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of South Carolina","location":{"addressLocality":"Columbia","addressRegion":"SC"}}}},{"name":"1959-1963. 15 feet.
