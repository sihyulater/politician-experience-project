The collection was deposited via a loan agreement to the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Elmer E. Rasmuson Library in 2009. After the preliminary inventory was completed, the collection was transferred to the Ted Stevens Foundation in 2015. The archival staff is currently engaged in finer processing of the entire collection by topic, and as such, the collection is closed for research. Once the finer processing is complete, the Foundation anticipates opening the collection to research, and to utilize the collection in curriculum development and for other public interest activities. Beginning in 2012, items from the collection were selected for digitization, including press releases, newsletters, and speeches. Documents were selected based on current events, topic significance, and Foundation activities, such as the production of an oral history roundtable, and events centered on the Senator’s work. Some of the major topics include issues that Senator Stevens worked to address, including the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation Fishery Act, Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, telemedicine, essential air service, bypass mail, the Denali Commission, Trans-Alaska pipeline, Arctic and climate issues, and the U.N.
