The bulk of the material documents the years 1945-1951, Gossett's last three terms in Congress. Almost all of the material in the Gossett Papers is the product of his legislative interests and activities; there is virtually nothing about personal or other political matters. Indeed, perhaps the greatest research value of the Gossett Papers derives from the fact that the bulk of the material deals with two major issues confronting the post-World War II Congress in which Gossett played a major role: the problem of the displaced persons in post-war Europe and the Texas tidelands conflict. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Baylor Collections of Political Materials","location":{"addressLocality":"Waco","addressRegion":"TX"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Baylor University","location":{"addressLocality":"Waco","addressRegion":"TX"}}}},{"name":"1969, 46 pages.","recordType":["Oral history"],"description":"A series of interviews were conducted with Ed Gossett in 1969 for the Texas Political History Oral History Project.
