The articles originate from several newspapers around the nation. Since Bernard Rodey saved only clippings that contained his name, the scrapbook is a summary of the issues that Bernard Rodey advocated for during his tenure in Congress. The majority of articles relate to New Mexico's bid for statehood, but some document Bernard Rodey's advocacy for public trust lands and state debts. The scrapbook covers the time period of 1902-1904. No explanations or writings by Bernard Rodey are contained in the book.","recordLocation":{"name":"Center for Southwest Research","location":{"addressLocality":"Albuquerque","addressRegion":"NM"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of New Mexico","url":"http://www/unm.edu/~cswrref/","location":{"addressLocality":"Albuquerque","addressRegion":"NM"}}}}],"deleted":false}
