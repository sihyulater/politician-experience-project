The first, written in the spring of 1861, is addressed to the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, and touches on Benjamin Butler's concern for what he calls the \"negro question,\" that is, the official status of the slaves in Confederate territory occupied by Union troops. Benjamin Butler would continue to deal with African-American issues throughout the war and his subsequent political career. The second letter comes from 1868, when Benjamin Butler's new career in Congress was being haunted by his actions during the war. Benjamin Butler writes to the <i>Boston Journal</i> seeking to set the record straight about lawsuits that have been brought against him by angry Southerners. The third letter, from 1889, shows that even late in life, Benjamin Butler was still plagued by questions about his actions in New Orleans, in this instance the 1862 execution of a man charged with tearing down a United States flag from a government building. The letter is addressed to either Curtis Guild, a Boston newspaperman, or his son, Curtis Guild, Jr., a politician and future governor. Also included is a handwritten transcript of an interview conducted in June 1862 between General Butler and Captain Homer B. Sprague of the 13th Regiment of Connecticut Volunteers, prepared by Captain Sprague in New Orleans. Captain Sprague had refused to surrender a fugitive slave now in his regiment's employ to slave hunters, and General Butler was called in to settle the matter. The document reveals Benjamin Butler's thinking on the subject, and the fine line he was forced to walk in dealing with slavery-related issues. After reviewing the case, Butler allowed the fugitive girl to remain with the Union Army.
