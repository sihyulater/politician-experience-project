Included in the collection are correspondence files of interest to students of mid-twentieth-century Alabama politics. In addition, the collection includes Kenneth Roberts's appointments diaries and one diary-like booklet in which he wrote the script for a stump speech on behalf of presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. The papers also contain materials pertaining to his long-term interest in consumer and automobile safety and to the electrification of the Coosa River Valley by means of the construction of dams. Most of the artifacts associated with the collection are typical mementos of a successful congressional career. One group of artifacts, however, vividly recalls the 1954 attack by Puerto Rican nationalists on the U.S. House of Representatives, an attack in which Kenneth Roberts was wounded. Somehow he was able to secure, among other objects, the flag his assailants displayed during the attack.
