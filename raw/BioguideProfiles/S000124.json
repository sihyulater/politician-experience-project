Scheuer Papers are organized into six series: 1. Legislative Work; 2. Organizations and Conferences; 3. Other Writings; 4. Correspondence; 5. Office Documents; and 6. Secondary Works about James Scheuer. The heart of the collection lies in the first two series which document Scheuer's achievements in his many years as a Congressman and as a elder statesman in non-governmental organizations. The four other series, especially Series 6, provide background information. Series 6 includes newspaper clippings and scrapbooks of clippings that have been copied onto acid-free paper. Series 3 includes some handwritten notes taken by Scheuer during a meeting with President Anwar el-Sadat in 1976. Much of the material in this collection represents the public side of Scheuer's career rather than personal papers. Series 4, Correspondence, does include some letters from other members of Congress that go beyond standard congratulations, invitations, and recommendations. Series 5 gives some hint about what it took to run a Representative's office, especially in the few detailed staff memos that survived. Each series is arranged in chronological order, with a few exceptions in Series 5, Office Documents. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Friends Historical Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Swarthmore","addressRegion":"PA"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Swarthmore College","location":{"addressLocality":"Swarthmore","addressRegion":"PA"}}}}]}
