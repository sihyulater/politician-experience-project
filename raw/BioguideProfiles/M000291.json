The collection dates primarily from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s, when Congressman Mazzoli was in (or seeking) office, although there is earlier material that documents his childhood and family life. Types of materials range from correspondence to campaign material, from records relating to his service on Congressional committees to his work on behalf of individual constituents, and include photographs and audio-visual materials. The collection documents his day to day schedule before, during and after his terms in Congress via 18 linear feet of schedules, calendars, itineraries, and guest books. His literary production, such as articles, speeches, and transcripts from public forums, are also represented in a similar quantity. In addition, records of his campaigns -- from his 1967 campaign for the Kentucky State Senate through his campaigns for each term of office -- make up a total of more than 27 linear feet of materials, including financial records, organizational records, brochures, bumper stickers and letters to voters. The day-to-day operation of a congressional office is documented in general office files. Legislative work represents the largest subset of materials, totaling over 200 linear feet. This series documents all of Congressman Mazzoli’s work in Congress, other than committee work, which by itself totals more than eighty linear feet. The collection also contains files on various issues, subjects and projects, both general and local. General issues are those things that were of concern to people all across the United States, and about which local people often contact their representatives in Washington. Examples include abortion, school busing, the Equal Rights Amendment, tobacco, and Watergate. Local projects are focused on actions and issues specific to the Third District of Kentucky, such as the fate of the Naval Ordnance Station in Louisville, the development of the Louisville Waterfront, Kosmosdale, and the expansion of Standiford Field. Together the records of general and local issues total over one hundred linear feet. In addition, there is a small amount of information relating to local Democratic Party politics, including local Democratic clubs. Thirty-one linear feet of case files chronicle the assistance that Congressman Mazzoli and his staff gave to constituents encountering problems with the federal bureaucracy. These materials are a randomly sampled 10% of the case files originally transferred from the Congressman’s offices. These files, and the files of those nominated for military academies, are restricted due to the personal nature of the contents of many of these files. The nominations to the military academies were also culled, and consist only of those candidates who ultimately attended the academies. The collection includes a substantial amount of correspondence, which is found throughout the papers but concentrated in a series titled \"general and personal correspondence\" that totals more than fifty linear feet. Correspondence includes invitations and responses, copies of notes sent by the Congressman, and form letters as well as personal correspondence for the period from 1995 to 2000. The collection also contains a small amount of documents and photographs covering Mazzoli’s family history and Italian heritage, his family life and other aspects of his pre- and post-political career. In addition, there are fifty linear feet of news clippings, summaries and videos of coverage of Mazzoli. Finally, the papers include twenty-eight linear feet of photographs, both official and otherwise, along with video and audio tapes of interviews and media appearances, including his own \"In Congress with Ron Mazzoli\" program.","recordLocation":{"name":"University Archives and Records Center","location":{"addressLocality":"Louisville","addressRegion":"KY"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Louisville","url":"http://www.louisville.edu/library/uarc","location":{"addressLocality":"Louisville","addressRegion":"KY"}}}},{"name":"In the Sierra Club National Legislative Office Records, 1960-[on-going], approximately 200 linear feet.","recordType":["Papers"],"description":"Persons represented include Romano Mazzoli.","recordLocation":{"name":"The Bancroft Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Berkeley","addressRegion":"CA"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","location":{"addressLocality":"Berkeley","addressRegion":"CA"}}}},{"name":"67 hours.","recordType":["Oral history"],"description":"The oral history component was a vital part of this project and truly contributes to Congressman Ron Mazzoli's legacy, but also enhances our understanding of the history of Louisville as well as that of the United States Congress. There are 67 hours of interviews, with almost 30 of those hours with Mr. Mazzoli himself. They cover a variety of topics including his Italian ancestry and family history, his childhood years and education, his political and non-political careers, and important subjects and people dealt with during his career. The other interviewees were his immediate family members, most of his Louisville and Washington staff people, Congressional advisors and staff, some of his campaign volunteers, and two of his colleagues in the Congress. These comprehensive interviews provide valuable insight into how our government works on a day-to-day level and the part played by family, staff and volunteers in our political process. They also reveal thoughts and actions that were not documented in writing.
