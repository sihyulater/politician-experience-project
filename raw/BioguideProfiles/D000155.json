Dawson Papers concentrate on Dawson's last three terms in the US House of Representatives (1952-1958). The first section of the collection is composed of personal and political materials. These include correspondence with his wife, daughters, and brothers. There is also a twenty-six page autobiographical sketch written in 1970, and campaign literature from the 1954 and 1956 elections. Following the personal and political materials, is the UCRSP file. This is the only subject file which remains from Dawson's tenure in Congress. In his autobiographical sketch Dawson noted that he specifically preserved this file and donated it to the library because of the Colorado River Project's great importance to the state of Utah. The UCRSP file includes correspondence between Dawson and his constituents, his colleagues, conservation groups, and numerous local groups who supported the project. Also included are several versions of the House bill authorizing the project, informal vote tallies, notes on strategy for management of the bill on the House floor, government reports, maps, and cost estimates. There are materials from the propaganda campaign waged by supporters and opponents of the bill, including brochures and pamphlets published by the Upper Colorado River Grass Roots, Inc. Information on the individual units within the project, such as Flaming Gorge Dam, Glen Canyon Dam, the Gooseberry Project, and the Central Utah Project have been filed separately. The final portion of the collection is the correspondence file. The file consists of the carbon copies of letters sent form the congressman's office from 1953-1958. The letters are arranged alphabetically by last name of addressee. Most of the letters are replies to constituent correspondence expressing Dawson's position on certain issues or providing specific information about problems. The issues which appear most frequently are the condition of the led-zinc industry, the humane slaughter bill, the foreign orphans bill and the UCRSP. Other letters are replies to Dawson's congressional colleagues, officials in the federal government, and political supporters in Utah. Some letters concern Dawson's personal business affairs and problems of political patronage. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Special Collections, Marriott Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Salt Lake City","addressRegion":"UT"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Utah","location":{"addressLocality":"Salt Lake City","addressRegion":"UT"}}}}]}
