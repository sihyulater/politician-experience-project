Blanchard collection consists primarily of material relating to his congressional career, dating between 1974 and 1982. The collection is arranged in thirty-one series, which include Blanchard's personal files; the records of both his Washington and district offices; materials from five key Blanchard staff members; files relating to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, the Chrysler bail-out, and all of Blanchard's campaigns, including the 1982 gubernatorial campaign; and extensive correspondence files. The collection is very strong in materials relating to the day-to-day work of a Congressional office, especially in the materials from the district office and from Blanchard's staff members. The collection is also strong in constituent issue mail expressing a wide range of concerns. The collection contains some materials pre-dating Blanchard's election to Congress, including correspondence, in both his and Ron Thayer's files, as well as in the campaign files. In addition, the collection contains several volumes, primarily committee prints and records of hearings related to the auto industry or industry and revitalization. The collection also includes over sized materials and audio visual materials. The audio visual materials include cassette tapes, video and television tapes, reel-to-reel tapes and a scrapbook. A list and brief description of all these materials appears at the end of the container listing. There are several major gaps in the Blanchard Collection. While Congressman Blanchard was a member of the House Committee on Science and Technology throughout his term in Congress, the collection contains no materials relating to the Committee or its subcommittees. In addition, the materials received from the Blanchard for Congress Committee, which was responsible for three of the re-election campaigns, are incomplete. The collection also lacks significant materials from Shelby Solomon, a member of Blanchard's staff from 1975 and his Administrative Assistant from 1980, though extensive files from other Blanchard staff members were included. Finally, the series Subject Files, an alphabetical series of subject files on issues and legislation, is missing the \"F-Z\" files.","recordLocation":{"name":"University Archives and Historical Collections","location":{"addressLocality":"East Lansing","addressRegion":"MI"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Michigan State University","location":{"addressLocality":"East Lansing","addressRegion":"MI"}}}},{"name":"1985, 1 file.","recordType":["Electronic records"],"description":"A broadcast on WKAR-FM, January 23, 1985.
