the 16th District of Ohio. All materials in the collection were compiled by the office of Congressman Regula, with the exception of the items pertaining to his various election campaigns. These materials were compiled by his campaign committees. Over the course of his long career in the House of Representatives, Congressman Regula moved his office location numerous times. Unfortunately, many of the records produced by his office, especially records dating from the 1970s, were discarded during these office moves. The majority of the records documenting Congressman Regula's committee work in the 1970s, for example, are not found within the collection. However, the collection does document Regula's committee work from the 1980s to his retirement in January 2009, especially his work as chairman of two subcommittees of the House Committee on Appropriations.","recordLocation":{"name":"Ohio Congressional Archives","location":{"addressLocality":"Columbus","addressRegion":"OH"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"The Ohio State University Libraries","location":{"addressLocality":"Columbus","addressRegion":"OH"}}}}]}
