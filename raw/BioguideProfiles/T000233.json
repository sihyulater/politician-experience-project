Included are correspondence, memoranda, notes, background material, speeches, tapes, films, and files on press and publicity, legislation, and constituent cases. The papers are arranged into two public record series of gubernatorial papers and one manuscript collection that includes Thomson's congressional papers and his speeches. Covering Thomson's tenure as governor is general correspondence with constituents, legislators, state and party leaders, governmental executives, and others; memoranda; reports; background material; speeches; tape recordings; and films. While there is much routine administrative material and extensive correspondence on individual constitutent problems, there are also significant files on the economic development of the state, highway safety, conservation and the environment, the state budget and the prospect of a sales tax, and the St. Lawrence Seaway and Wisconsin's participation in the Great Lakes Compact Commission. There is little of a personal or political nature, although there are many letters from citizens concerning the vacancy created by the death of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and some material on Thomson's support of Robert Taft in 1952. Documenting his career as a member of Congress is constituent correspondence, case and project files, and material on legislation which Thomson sponsored or introduced such as bills concerning tariffs on shoes, dairy and agricultural products, and lead and zinc, and benefits for Mexican border veterans. One file contains correspondence concerning Thomson's anti-gambling legislation introduced in 1945. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Archives Division","location":{"addressLocality":"Madison","addressRegion":"WI"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Wisconsin Historical Society","location":{"addressLocality":"Madison","addressRegion":"WI"}}}},{"name":"In the Walter H.
