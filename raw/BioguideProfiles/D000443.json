Filed with the Doty papers are copies of Circuit Court records for Brown County, mainly for the years 1822-1823. The unbound papers are most numerous for the years 1839-1844 when Doty served as delegate to Congress and governor of Wisconsin Territory. There are references to early road building, to the establishing of a territorial government in Wisconsin and adjusting its boundaries, to the Menominee treaty of 1832, and to prospective immigration to Wisconsin. Among the letters are several from John Jacob Astor, William B. Astor, Lewis Cass, Henry Clay, N. P. Tallmadge, Daniel Webster, James Wilson, Austin E. Wing, and William Woodbridge. Three items concern early Mackinac; a few papers of Doty's sons, Charles and James, and his daughter, Mary Doty Fitzgerald, are present; as are photostats of two commissions, 1863-1864, from Abraham Lincoln appointing Doty territorial governor of Utah. Also included in the collection are microfilmed copies of documents held by the Henry E.

The Western Reserve items date 1777 and 1822-1843. The National Archives items (1836-1841) concern Doty's nomination as governor of Wisconsin Territory and come from the records of the U.S. Senate.
