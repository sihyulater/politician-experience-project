There are very few materials regarding her personal life outside of her professional career. Types of materials include correspondence, reports and research materials, speeches, journal and newspaper articles, press releases, photographs, and video and audio tapes. The bulk of the papers date from 1993 to 1998 and focus on Harman's first three terms as a U.S. Representative from the 36th district of California. Major topics found in her political and legislative papers include national defense and the military (including women in the armed forces), the environment, space and technology, California-related issues, the Democratic National Party, health care, abortion and domestic and international economic concerns. Generally, there are more materials available from later in her political and legislative career than from the earlier years. Correspondence comprises at least half of the collection. Also well-represented are background and research materials that her staff used in legislative and political matters. Notable correspondents include: Les Aspin, Samuel Berger, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, Sen. Robert Byrd, President Jimmy Carter, President Bill Clinton, Gloria Feldt and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Vice President Al Gore, Judith L. Lichtman (Women's Legal Defense Fund), Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, Ruth J. Simmons (Smith College president, 1995-2001), and Gloria Steinem. An inventory is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"The Sophia Smith Collection","location":{"addressLocality":"Northampton","addressRegion":"MA"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Smith College","location":{"addressLocality":"Northampton","addressRegion":"MA"}}}}]}
