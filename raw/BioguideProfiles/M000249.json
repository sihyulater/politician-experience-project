The collection encompasses a range of materials--including correspondence, legislative addresses, campaign literature, press releases, schedules, and ephemera--most notably documenting such legislation and issues as: health care, social security, tax, and welfare reform; the North American Free Trade Agreement and approval of the Uruguay Round Agreements; civil rights and Japanese American internment redress; Sacramento regional water and flood control; and district military base closures.
