Obey was noted for his leadership in the House Appropriations Committee, particularly its Foreign Operations, and Labor-Health &amp; Social Services and Education subcommittees, as well as his dedication to Wisconsin's Progressive political tradition and his efforts to use government to improve people's lives. The papers concern both national and Wisconsin issues, with many topics such as educational reform, environmentalism, and health care bridging both. Wisconsin topics that are well documented include agriculture and the dairy industry, Native American treaty rights, Hmong refugee resettlement, transportation, and the decline of manufacturing. National topics of note are campaign finance and budget reform, foreign relations and international trade, abortion and religion in politics, and cancer research and occupational health and safety. His papers include speeches and writings, floor remarks, and interviews (some in audio and video form); correspondence; unofficial Appropriations Committee files; press releases, newsletters, clippings, photographs, and other press material; video tapes and sound recordings; district office files; campaign files; and extensive subject files created by members of his staff. A few files document his career as a member of the Wisconsin Assembly (1963-1969). Also included are interviews conducted by Anita Hecht in 2014 and produced by the Wisconsin Institute for Public Policy and Service in which Obey shares his memories and insights on his nearly 50 years of public service.
