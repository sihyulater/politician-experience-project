There is an incomplete name index to the correspondence. Although the collection contains virtually no working files on legislation, there are excellent materials on efforts to maintain contact with constituents. Additional subjects in which Baldus was particularly interested and which are well documented include agriculture, the dairy industry, small business, solar energy, practical politics, the Cuban emigrees at Fort McCoy, and the LaFarge Dam controversy. State legislative files include information on tort reform and on establishing a labor concession lien to protect employees (prompted by the closing of the Uniroyal company in Eau Claire, Wis.). A finding aid is available in the repository.","recordLocation":{"name":"University Archives and Area Research Center, University of Wisconsin-Stout","location":{"addressLocality":"Menomonie","addressRegion":"WI"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Wisconsin Historical Society","location":{"addressLocality":"Madison","addressRegion":"WI"}}}}]}
