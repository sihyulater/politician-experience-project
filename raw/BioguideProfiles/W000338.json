Unfortunately, Wheeler did not regularly keep records of his responses until the late 1890s, and then only during the months he was on active duty. Within the Political/Post-political series of the Joseph Wheeler subgroup, the letters and correspondence cover such topics as patronage, a variety of U.S. Postal Service issues, military appropriations, claims and pension settlements, the development of Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River, Alabama politics, the free silver issue, and the Spanish-American and Civil wars, on which he wrote extensively. Other topics include tariff issues, elections, education, and African American soldiers' claims. The Joseph Wheeler papers also include letters and correspondence on personal and family matters as well as financial, business, and legal topics, the latter being generated by the extensive and complicated Wheeler real property lawsuits.","recordLocation":{"name":"Alabama Department of Archives and History","location":{"addressLocality":"Montgomery","addressRegion":"AL"}}},{"name":"In the Wheeler family photographs, [188?]-1923, 45 photographs.","recordType":["Photographs"],"description":"The collection includes images of Joseph Wheeler in Washington, D.C., including one of the House of Representatives in session and another of the capitol reading room.","recordLocation":{"name":"Alabama Department of Archives and History","location":{"addressLocality":"Montgomery","addressRegion":"AL"}}},{"name":"1854, 1 page.","recordType":["Papers"],"description":"A letter from Joseph Wheeler to his sister, Lucy, written on July 2, 1854.
