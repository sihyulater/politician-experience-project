This collection represents Button's administrative actions during his two terms as a U.S. Representative: his contributions to legislation, files he received concerning domestic concerns and foreign relations, a sizable amount of correspondence he received from Albany residents, military case files for every military branch, as well as press releases and teleprompter papers for televised events. Button served on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee as well as the Post Office and Civil Services Commission. Materials related to these assignments are dispersed throughout the collection, primarily in subject files and subject correspondence. Button also sponsored several bills pertaining to these two committees. While in office, Joseph or \"Joe\" Parillo was Button's personal assistant in his Schenectady office. Also, Button had at least two secretaries who assisted him with his correspondence and case files. There are a number of records that contain notes regarding cases from these personnel. Please note there is no material concerning Button's two books in this collection. There is also no material about his work at Times-Union, University at Albany, or his contributions to different societies. The entirety of this collection is from his time as U.S. Representative. A repository is available in the repository.","recordLocation":{"name":"M.E.
