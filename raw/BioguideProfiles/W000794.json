The collection includes press clippings collected and arranged by Watson's staff, a sizable collection of photographs from events throughout Watson's career, correspondence, and documents from various events, meetings, and conferences. The collection also contains materials related to specific areas of interest for Watson, including the controversy over Ebonics in the Oakland, Calif., School District in the mid-1990s, the Sherrice Iverson Justice Committee, and the debate over the downsizing of the King/Drew medical center. Additionally, the collection includes mementos from Watson's trip to South Korea in August, 2010-particularly significant as her Congressional district included Los Angeles's Koreatown, the largest population of Koreans outside of Korea. Mementos from the trip include Watson's honorary doctorate from Chung Ang University, Korean literature panels, and souvenir menus from banquets in Watson's honor.
