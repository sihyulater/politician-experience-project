A finding aid is available in the repository. A 2011 addition to the papers consists of materials used by Congressman Pickle and his daughter Peggy in the course of writing Pickle’s biography. Peggy Pickle attached written descriptions to a number of materials and also included items collected after Pickle’s death. Consisting of seven and a half linear feet, this addition is arranged into four distinct series: Personal, Professional, Photographs, and Scrapbooks. The Personal series illuminates Pickle’s familial relationships, including those with his first and second wives and daughter Peggy. The Professional series encompasses Pickle’s career in both the private and public sectors, primarily his tenure in Congress and campaigns. Notable correspondents include John Connally, Hubert Humphrey, Bill Clinton, and Pickle’s mentor Lyndon B. Johnson, including a long letter celebrating the success of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Photography and Scrapbooks series pertain to Pickle’s professional and personal life, particularly Pickle’s relationship with the family of Lyndon B. Johnson through photos and letters.","recordLocation":{"name":"Briscoe Center for American History","location":{"addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Texas at Austin","location":{"addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX"}}}},{"name":"1970-1972.","recordType":["Oral history"],"description":"Restricted.","recordLocation":{"name":"Briscoe Center for American History","location":{"addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Texas at Austin","location":{"addressLocality":"Austin","addressRegion":"TX"}}}},{"name":"In the UT Little Campus Dormitory Collection, ca. 1929-1990, approximately 2 feet.","recordType":["Papers"],"description":"Correspondents include J.J.
