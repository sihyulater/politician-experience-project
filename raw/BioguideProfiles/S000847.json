Brief personal files relate to his first term in Congress and to his prior career in the Wisconsin Assembly and as a leader in Republican student politics. The files are generally arranged by function or by subject, with indexes to individual correspondents. Documentation is extensive on a number of legislative initiatives with which William Steiger was connected: The Williams-Steiger Bill, which established OSHA, and the Steiger Amendment which reduced capital gains taxation in 1978. There are also files on the all-volunteer army of the post-Watergate era and congressional reform. Arising from his membership on the Education and Labor and the Ways and Means committees are files on his interest in manpower legislation and legal services for the poor. There are also substantial files of correspondence on issues which stirred general constituent interest during his term in office such as abortion, environment, Watergate and Vietnam. The press material includes press releases, newsletters (additional titles are available on microfilm in the SHSW Library), clippings, speeches, and statements. Extensively weeded case files primarily concern the Selective Service and Vietnamese immigration. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Archives Division","location":{"addressLocality":"Madison","addressRegion":"WI"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Wisconsin Historical Society","location":{"addressLocality":"Madison","addressRegion":"WI"}}}}]}
