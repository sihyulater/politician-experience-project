Murtha Congressional Papers comprise over 300 boxes of paper-based materials, audio-visual materials, and three-dimensional objects generated or gathered and in the care of the office of Rep. Murtha during his 36 years of congressional service (1974-2010) as congressman from Pennsylvania's 12th District. The material includes administrative files, personal and campaign materials, legislative files, project files, correspondence, and material relating to the Iraq War. In addition to the large amount of paper materials, there is also a substantial amount of audio-visual materials, including photographs, moving images, and sound recordings, as well as a collection of objects, awards, and memorabilia. In order to preserve the integrity of the collection, as well as efficiently use time and resources, a substantial effort was made to keep much of the collection in original order and are in some cases arranged alphabetically and chronologically. Given the size of the collection, it is highly suggested that keyword searches are used to find and locate material within the collection. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"John P.
