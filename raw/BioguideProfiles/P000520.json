Also documented are the Preyers' extensive civic and philanthropic work for education, the environment, health care, legal affairs, politics, social uplift, and the First Presbyterian Church.

Preyer's law practice and judicial appointments are also documented, as are his speaking and teaching activities after 1981. These materials reflect Preyer's interests in education, the Democratic Party, ethics, media, politics, and health policy. Emily Harris Preyer papers include speeches and other materials that document her roles as civic leader in her own right and supportive wife of a politician.
