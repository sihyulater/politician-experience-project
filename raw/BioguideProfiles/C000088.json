Once in Washington, he entered into almost daily correspondence with his wife until his departure for Pennsylvania on August 3. This tightly-knit set of letters covers the initial panic in the District of Columbia when war broke out, the opening of Congress in July amid the crisis, early attempts of Clement Vallandigham to disrupt the Union, the death of the celebrated Colonel Ellsworth, and the fiasco at First Bull Run. A series of ten letters written in 1862 and 1863 relate separate interviews with President Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, and give an account of a regiment hastily formed in the abortive attempt to cut off Lee's escape from Pennsylvania following Gettysburg.
