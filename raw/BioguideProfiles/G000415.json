The correspondence is divided into several categories: personal correspondence, campaign correspondence, correspondence regarding the House Rivers and Harbors Committee, veterans’ claims correspondence, endorsements of state and federal positions, and correspondence regarding legislation. A large portion of the collection (Boxes 21-39) is labeled miscellaneous correspondence and is organized chronologically. Of particular interest are items related to plans for the Cross Florida Barge Canal and the closing of Silver River to navigation. Papers covering these topics can be found with the Rivers and Harbors Committee correspondence and in the miscellaneous correspondence. During World War II Green was active in promoting the creation of air bases in Florida, and most of the letters pertaining to this can be found in miscellaneous correspondence after 1941. Other items of interest include bills that he introduced into the House of Representatives while in office. As is evident from these bills, he favored stricter immigration laws and increased pensions for veterans and the elderly. Green promoted development in Florida. Many war-time letters deal with problems that local businesses faced with supply and delivery of products. His constituents showed particular hostility towards the Office of Price Administration (OPA) and various other New Deal regulatory agencies. Additionally, the collection contains a significant amount of correspondence related to the Work Projects Administration (WPA) projects and veterans’ claims. These materials illustrate the operation of the federal government under Roosevelt and the New Deal. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Special and Area Studies Collections, Smather Libraries","location":{"addressLocality":"Gainesville","addressRegion":"FL"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Florida","location":{"addressLocality":"Gainesville","addressRegion":"FL"}}}}]}
