These unique primary sources include correspondence between Senator Smith and leading government officials, as well as constituent correspondence and government reports. Another important resource is the over 500 bound scrapbooks that thoroughly document her career as recorded in newspaper accounts and periodical literature. The scrapbooks also contain the newspaper column, Washington and You, written by Senator Smith between 1941 and 1954 and syndicated nationally from 1949 to 1954. Other highlights of the collection are 43 bound volumes of Senator Smith's speeches, press releases, and general statements; over 2400 historical photographs of state, national, and world leaders; and over 400 audio and video recordings of interviews, debates, and speeches.
