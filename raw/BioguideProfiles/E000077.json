Topics of note include cable and satellite television, the break-up of AT&amp;T, civil rights legislation, foreign affairs, energy policy, Contra Aid, Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, water projects, and military installations including Tinker Air Force Base. Because of Edward’s committee appointments there is also substantial information related to government appropriations and the budget. The Press series provides an interesting look at Oklahoma during Edward’s service with its news summaries that are typed indexes of each week’s main headlines across Oklahoma.
