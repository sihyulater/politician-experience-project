H. Schwarz represent a fragment of this state senator's career as much material had been discarded prior to the library's contact with the Schwarz office. Although some of the materials (mainly clippings) date to the period when he first came to Lansing in the mid-1980s, the great bulk of the collection dates from Schwarz's last term in office, 1999-2002. As might be expected, the files pertain to Schwarz's activities in the state senate, especially on issues of appropriations to the state's colleges and universities. There is also substantial information relating to current state health issues. Not present in these papers are materials relating to his activities outside the senate, campaigns for office, or his candidacy for governor in 2002. There are also no photographs or other visual materials in the collection. The papers have been brought together in the following series: Higher Education; Health Issues; Other Issues; and Miscellaneous. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Bentley Historical Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Ann Arbor","addressRegion":"MI"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Michigan","location":{"addressLocality":"Ann Arbor","addressRegion":"MI"}}}},{"name":"2002, 1 optical disc.","recordType":["Optical disc"],"description":"Homepage for Michigan State Senator J.
