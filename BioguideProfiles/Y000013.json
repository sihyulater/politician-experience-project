Yates consist of photocopied portions of a much larger collection of Sidney Yates papers that was transferred from the Truman Library to the Chicago Historical Society in 1999. At the same time, he permitted the Truman Library to retain in its holdings photocopies of those of his papers which pertained to his service, during the administration of President Truman, in the 81st and 82nd Congresses, from 1949 through 1952. The papers consist of two series, a Bills Introduced File and a Newsletters File. The Bills Introduced File is composed of two subseries, one for the 81st Congress and the other for the 82nd Congress. In addition to drafts of legislation introduced by Rep. Yates, the series includes correspondence with constituents and other interested parties; memoranda; press releases; congressional reports; transcripts of congressional hearings; printed material; and other items relating to the proposed legislation. Among the bills that Rep. Yates introduced during the 81st and 82nd Congresses were proposals to extend equality of treatment to Japanese and other Asian persons under U.S. immigration law; to provide for federal housing loans; to restrict the interstate transportation of fireworks; to establish rent controls; to create a Labor Extension Service within the U.S. Department of Labor; and to increase federal penalties for the sale of narcotics. Yates also introduced many private relief bills relating to immigration, including a number of bills that exempted the Japanese fiancees or wives of U.S. servicemen from the racial restrictions of the Immigration Act of 1924, thus allowing the women to come to the United States. The two subseries of the Bills Introduced File are arranged in alphabetical order by subject. The Newsletters File contains approximately 120 brief newsletters which Rep. Yates sent to his constituents on a weekly basis while Congress was in session, from March 17, 1949 to July 3, 1952. The newsletters provided information on legislation affecting Rep. Yates's constituents, and also featured interesting insights into the day-to-day activities of Congress and Rep. Yates's experiences as a junior member of the House of Representatives. Among other things, they document the struggle in Congress over President Truman's Fair Deal program of social welfare legislation, which Rep. Yates supported in his capacity as a liberal Democrat. The material in the Newsletters File is arranged in chronological order. More information relating to Representative Sidney R. Yates, including his correspondence with Mr. Truman, can be found in the Harry S. Truman Papers: White House Central Files: President's Personal File (PPF 4879) and in the Harry S. Truman Papers: Post-Presidential Papers (General Correspondence File).","recordLocation":{"name":"Harry S.
