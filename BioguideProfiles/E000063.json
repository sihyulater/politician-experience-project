S. House of Representatives and part of his tenure in the Texas Senate, including the following topics: campaigns, commencements, fundraisers. Of particular interest are records relating to the Branch Davidians, the Clinton Impeachment, and Religious Liberty. Edwards was a strong and effective voice on behalf of religious liberty, largely due to the influence of former Baylor University president Herbert H. Reynolds. Religious liberty documents are arranged alphabetically by topic. Each topic represents a major religious liberty/separation of church-state issue that transpired over his time in office. Included among the topics are: Charitable Choice (1995-2007), Religious Freedom Amendment (1994-2002), Religious Liberty Protection Act (1998-1999), and posting the Ten Commandments on public property (1997-2005). A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Baylor Collections of Political Materials","location":{"addressLocality":"Waco","addressRegion":"TX"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Baylor University","location":{"addressLocality":"Waco","addressRegion":"TX"}}}}]}
