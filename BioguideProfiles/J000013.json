Ca. 1235 cubic feet (bulk 1940-1983). The numerous accessions that make up the Henry M. Jackson papers measure approximately 1,235 cubic feet. They date from 1912 to 1987, with the bulk of the material from the period 1940-1983, Jackson's years in Congress. The papers document Jackson's career as a small-town attorney, member of Congress, United States senator, and presidential candidate. Accessions 3560-1 through 3560-20 represent the original body of papers donated to the University of Washington Libraries shortly after the Senator's death. The papers were divided into separate accessions by date and material type to facilitate processing as well as early access by researchers. Accessions 21 through 30 contain materials that were added subsequently. Accessions 31 through 34 were created in 2007 when audio, moving image, and photographic and graphic materials in the collection were reprocessed and relisted. Restrictions on Use Literary rights to the Jackson papers have been transferred to the University of Washington. However, copyright restrictions apply to incoming letters and may apply to many of the photographs, moving image materials, sound recordings, and political cartoons. Researchers are advised to consult with the staff of the Special Collections Division, University of Washington Libraries for further information. Restrictions on Access The Jackson papers are open to all researchers with the following exceptions: The case files in accessions 3560-1 (pre-congressional papers), 3560-6 (FPD papers), 3560-8 (House case files) and 3560-14 (Senate case files) as well as any individual case files in other accessions are restricted to use by graduate students, university faculty members, and others doing similar serious research. These users must sign a statement indicating an understanding of the restrictions on the dissemination of information contained in these files. These conditions also apply to the microfilm of outgoing letters in accession 3560-19, which includes correspondence from constituent case files. The Joel Merkel subgroup in box 330 of accession 3560-5 (Senate papers) is closed until an undetermined date before 2011.
