Nicholson from Charles Benedict Calvert written on September 29, 1858. In the letter, Charles Calvert describes his early plans for the Maryland Agricultural College, as the university was originally known. Writing from his home at Riversdale, Calvert tells Jacob Nicholson, a prominent printer in Baltimore, that \"We expect to teach everything that is taught in the best Universities\" and outlines specific courses to be included in the curriculum. He mentions laying the cornerstone for one of the two major buildings erected for the opening of the college and the plan to require students to engage \"at certain hours in all the outdoor operations of the farm and work shops.\" Calvert's active role as the founder of the Maryland Agricultural College is clear from his concluding sentence to Nicholson, as he urges him to send his son to the new institution when it opens and asks for Nicholson's financial support for the fledgling college.", "recordLocation" : { "name" : "Special Collections Division", "location" : { "addressLocality" : "College Park", "addressRegion" : "MD" }, "parentRecordLocation" : { "name" : "University of Maryland Libraries", "location" : { "addressLocality" : "College Park", "addressRegion" : "MD" } } } }] }
