Despite the national political prominence of the elder Babcock, a congressman from the Third District for fourteen years, the majority of the correspondence is personal in content. Included are letters from Joseph Weeks Babcock to his wife while he traveled for an Iowa lumber company during the 1870's and to his secretary Harry W. Barney while he traveled in Europe in 1901. There are also reminiscences of the elder Babcock written by Barney and a volume containing data on Third District Republican conventions. Pertaining to Charles Babcock are letters to and from his parents while he was a student at Oberlin College and the University of Michigan Law School and later while traveling abroad. There are also several ledgers and cash books pertaining to a real estate venture of Charles Babcock and Harry Barney. Photographs include portraits of family, friends, and associates of Babcock, ca. 1880-1890.
