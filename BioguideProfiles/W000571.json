Unruh, Assemblyman 65th District and Charles H. Wilson, Congressman 31st District, located at 1902 St. Andrews Place. Some picket signs read: \"Wilson: use your own stamps\"; \"Wilson: Don't be so proud of your record\"; \"We want honesty not travesty\"; \"Californians protest. Wilson uses tax money to campaign\"; etc. It appears that the picketing is against Congressman Charlie Wilson, as Assemblyman Jesse Unruh's name does not appear on any of the signs pictured.
