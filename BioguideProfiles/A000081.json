The possibility of starting an “anti-corruptionist” party in Minnesota was discussed in a letter from Congressman Cyrus Aldrich, March 5, 1859. Aldrich felt he and Folsom were on the side of the people against the plunderers and corruptionists, who were ruining the state by floating a 5,000,000 dollar loan. On that same day James M. Cavanaugh wrote from Washington to tell of his own efforts in behalf of a resolution to permit the sales of public lands in Minnesota and of his hope that he would someday secure the passage of his homestead act. Congressman Aldrich wrote again, March 12, 1859, a very bitter letter about “corruption” in state finance and the sale of state bonds. At the end of the letter, in discussing the coming election, he mentioned that “Young Washburne” desired to become a candidate. D.S. Norton wrote to Folsom also, May 2, 1859, to ask for support in the coming election. On that same day, May 2, 1859, Aldrich wrote again to condemn the use of tax money to pay interest on railroad bonds and to comment on the opening of a bank in Folsom's area by “corruptionists.” The papers are owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society, Library-Archives Division.", "recordLocation" : { "name" : "University Archives and Area Research Center, Chalmer Davee Library", "location" : { "addressLocality" : "River Falls", "addressRegion" : "WI" }, "parentRecordLocation" : { "name" : "University of Wisconsin-River Falls", "location" : { "addressLocality" : "River Falls", "addressRegion" : "WI" } } } }, { "name" : "1862, 1 item.", "recordType" : ["Papers"], "description" : "A letter from Abraham Lincoln written on December 6, 1862, to Cyrus Aldrich.
