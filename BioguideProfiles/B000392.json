She discusses the influence of her mother ,who ran a boarding house in small Nevada mining towns, and her determination to strive for excellence and achieve success in fields where women were rarely seen. Her narrative takes us through her experiences as a journalist and she tells the story of her tenacious battle to secure appointment to the post of Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission. Mrs. Bentley discusses in detail her work with Barbara Franklin and her relationships with women journalists and women in the Congress. Her reflections on the problems women faced, sometimes of their own making, is revealing; her attitudes towards her work and the pride in breaking barriers and opening the door for other women is evident. Her own election to Congress is another reflection of the qualities she regarded as essential to the success of women in government generally.","recordLocation":{"name":"Special Collections, Paterno Library","location":{"addressLocality":"University Park","addressRegion":"PA"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"The Pennsylvania State University","location":{"addressLocality":"University Park","addressRegion":"PA"}}}}]}
