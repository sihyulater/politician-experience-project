Sawyer, Mayor of Akron includes the years 1983-1986 and covers a range of topics relating to the governance of Akron in the mid 1980s. This includes Series 1: Office subject files consisting of correspondence, budget and development plans, public relations activities and reports from the cities departments and Series 2: Deputy Mayor's Recycle Energy System files. Of note in this collection are the Recycle Energy System files. Shortly before the Sawyer Administration took office there was an explosion at Akron's Recycling Plant resulting in the death of three people. The Recycle Energy System files in this collection follow the investigation, actions, and the reports concerning that incident. The Recycle Energy System files of Deputy Mayor Anthony O'Leary were included with the Donation of the Mayor's files. His files are organized as a separate series since he was part of Mayor Sawyer's cabinet but maintained his office records separately. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Archival Services, University Libraries","location":{"addressLocality":"Akron","addressRegion":"OH"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Akron","location":{"addressLocality":"Akron","addressRegion":"OH"}}}}],"deleted":false}
