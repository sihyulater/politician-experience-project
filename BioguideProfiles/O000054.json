There are several letters from family and from constituents in North Carolina. In addition, three folders are devoted to photographs of Representative O'Hara, his wife and son, and associates. An important and detailed resource for the study of the O'Hara family and the social history of the late nineteenth century South is the biographical sketch of Representative O'Hara and his family written by his granddaughter, Vera Jean O'Hara Rivers, and entitled \"A Thespian Must Play His Role.\" Finally, the collection includes some ephemeral material, such as a handbill announcing the establishment of a Canadian newspaper for fugitive slaves, an autograph book and \"Register of Documents sent\" owned by James E. O'Hara, and a small twentieth century booklet of biographical sketches that includes a brief description of Representative O'Hara. An inventory is available in the repository and online.","findingAid":false,"recordLocation":{"name":"Special Collections Research Center","location":{"addressLocality":"Chicago","addressRegion":"IL"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of Chicago Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Chicago","addressRegion":"IL"}}}}]}
