Etheridge served seven terms in the United States House of Representatives for North Carolinaâ€™s second congressional district from 1997 through 2010. Other collection materials pertain chiefly to Etheridge's two terms as the North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction and include education files for each North Carolina county. Congressional papers include correspondence; printed items such as House resolutions and congressional reports; newspaper clippings; policy papers; transcripts of congressional hearings; talking points for public speaking engagements; and materials related to House committees on which Etheridge served. The breadth of topics in the congressional papers is extensive covering both foreign and domestic policy and reflecting the political climate of post Cold War America during the presidential administrations of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barak Obama. The collection does not contain much, if any, campaign or election materials. Acquired as part of the Southern Historical Collection. A finding aid is avaiilable in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Chapel Hill","addressRegion":"NC"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","location":{"addressLocality":"Chapel Hill","addressRegion":"NC"}}}}]}
