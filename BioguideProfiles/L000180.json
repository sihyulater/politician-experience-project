One hundred sixty boxes were sent from Washington, DC, but 48 boxes were lost in transit. The materials came organized by the congressional office. The bulk of the boxes (90 boxes)contain numbered correspondence files, with 63 notebooks of replies and a 7-notebook correspondence index. Unfortunately the numbered system used by the office was not transferred with the papers. The correspondence are dated throughout his service in Congress, from 1981-1990. The next largest type of material are 10 boxes of sponsored/cosponsored legislation. These also date from 1989-1990. The remainder consists of press releases and clippings, speeches, invitations, newsletters, financial papers [budgets and expense reports] and several notebooks containing his personal voting record. Framed photos and plagues that make up the last 6 boxes were received in October, 1996 when Mr. Leath's office was relocating to Virginia.","recordLocation":{"name":"Baylor Collections of Political Materials","location":{"addressLocality":"Waco","addressRegion":"TX"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Baylor University","location":{"addressLocality":"Waco","addressRegion":"TX"}}}}]}
