At the same time, he was attentive to the needs of his constituents and won re-election with little opposition. Composed of many different types of material, the Nichols Collection contains a great wealth of information dealing with the congressman's legislative activities in the Alabama House and Senate (1959-1966) and in the U.S. House of Representatives (1967-1988). Newspaper clippings, pamphlets, brochures, constituency correspondence, photographs, negatives, financial records, postcards, telegrams, legislative and committee files, scrapbooks (two microfilmed reels), audiocassettes, videotapes, speeches, press releases, questionnaires, and newsletters are all represented in the Nichols Papers.
