Richard Bolling's papers provide original, firsthand insight into a variety of national issues, including civil rights, labor reform, the federal budget process, and liberalism. In particular, the collection pertains to Richard Bolling's most direct and lasting influence as a participant in the efforts to reform Congress in the early 1970s. He was arguably the most important player in this reform movement and he was largely responsible for bringing to the floor many of the committee rules and structural changes considered during the 93rd Congress (1973-74). As chair of the Select Committee on Committees at this time, Richard Bolling spearheaded this reform movement which transformed the legislative process during the 1970s and created our current system.
