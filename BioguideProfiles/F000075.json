These include both the establishment, and subsequent closing, of the Anthracite Research Laboratory in Schuylkill Haven, 1940-1965; the successful attempt to route Interstate 83 (sometimes known as the \"Anthracite Highway\") through Pennsylvania's \"coal region,\" 1958; and activities of the local Republican Party in Schuylkill County. Among other noteworthy items is a photograph album covering the tour of the United States Army Service Command General Hospitals under Army Surgeon General Norman Kirk in 1945 and an album covering a visit by members of the House Appropriations Committee to the Tennessee Valley Authority's Muscle Shoals hydroelectric facility in 1957.","recordLocation":{"name":"Pennsylvania State Archives","location":{"addressLocality":"Harrisburg","addressRegion":"PA"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission","location":{"addressLocality":"Harrisburg","addressRegion":"PA"}}}}]}
