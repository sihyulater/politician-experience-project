1938, 1963, 1970-2004 (bulk 1987-2004) Ca.781 linear feet. Correspondence, briefing books, bills, reports, testimony transcripts, research files, casework, news releases, printed materials, audio-visual and electronic files, photographs and memorabilia documenting the political and U.S. Congressional career of Louisiana Representative (1972-1986) and Senator (1987-2004) John B. Breaux, and the work of his office. The collection is organized into the following subgroups or sections: U. S. Senate, Political, Social, and U.S. House of Representatives. Senate records reflect the work of Senator Breaux and his staffers on legislation, committee work, representing the interests of Louisiana and her citizens to Congress and government agencies, and the inner workings of a congressional office and activities of elected officials. House records contain similar materials. Political papers relate to Breauxâ€™s elections and campaigns, his leadership roles in the Democratic Party, and centrist groups. Social files include memorabilia and relate primarily to the Washington Mardi Gras. Access Restrictions House committee records are restricted for thirty years and Senate committee records are restricted for twenty years from the date of creation. (See Rules XI and XXVI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and Senate Rules XI and XXVI 10 (a), and S. Res. 474, 96th Congress.) Commission files will follow the same rules and procedures. Appointment files are also restricted for fifteen years from January 1 of the year of their creation. Due to their condition, use of scrapbooks requires permission of the Curator of Manuscripts, as does access to original VIP items in the vault. Photocopies of the latter are available in the folders from which the originals were removed.
