The records focus on numerous political, social, and military issues in which he was involved at the local, state, national, and international levels. Documentation is especially strong on such matters as the development of the East Tennessee State University medical school, patriotism and legislation on protection of the American flag, community and economic development in the first congressional district of Tennessee, the Republican Party, and Tennessee and United States politics and political elections.
