Herbert Burke contain correspondence, biographical information, press releases, speeches, campaign materials, legislative papers, and photographs of Representative J. Herbert Burke of Florida. The Burke Papers, spanning 1966-1996, document his activities as a legislator in the U.S. House, including his campaign efforts, his committee service, and the management of his office. Unlike most political collections, the Burke Papers contain a very small amount of correspondence and materials pertaining to legislation. The collection does include a number of Burke's newsletters, covering his congressional activities, as well as his voting and attendance records. The speeches and campaign files document his views on a variety of political issues during his tenure in the House. The majority of the photographs in the collection were taken by congressional photographers, although there are a few personal photographs. The photos primarily show Burke meeting with other politicians, members of the Florida delegation, foreign dignitaries, and various people and groups from Florida. There are several photos taken during committee trips and hearings, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries. The collection also includes a small group of the papers and writings of Lois Blackburn, Burke's administrative assistant. The majority of these papers were written in the 1990s, around the time of Burke's death. These materials (Box 14) currently are closed to public access due to privacy concerns. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Special and Area Studies Collections, George A.
