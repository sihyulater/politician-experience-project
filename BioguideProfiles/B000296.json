The papers document Beckworth's political career as a U.S. representative, Texas state senator, and judge. The papers include recordings of reports to constituents (1942-1946) and photographs of Beckworth and his family, political figures, presidents, and Texans from the 1940s through the 1970s. Notable examples are photographs of Beckworth with his family at dinner, with his three sons, with members of the Northeast Texas Bar Association, and as a winner of declamation contests while in school. Photographs of the Texas congressional delegation during the Sam Rayburn years (1940-1961) and signed pictures of such notable Texans as Senator Tom Connally, Admiral Chester D. Nimitz, Amon Carter, Wright Patman, Governor Preston Smith, and presidents Lyndon Johnson and Dwight Eisenhower chronicle influences on Beckworth's career and the associations he made during twenty-eight years in legislative service. A guest register from Beckworth's congressional office (1948-1984) provides biographical information. A small body of letters documents Beckworth's voting record, status as the youngest person elected a U.S. representative in the twentieth century, and support of a state bill regarding rehabilitation eligibility for crippled children. An undated handwritten note deals with Beckworth's advocacy of a firm stand in Vietnam.
