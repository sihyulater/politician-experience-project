A significant portion of materials pertain to his service on the Government Operations and Foreign Affairs Committees, as well as the Congressional Human Rights Caucus; also prominent in the collection are Lantos' office and press files, personal correspondence, and a limited amount of campaign and political files. The collection encompasses a range of materials-including correspondence, legislative addresses and hearings, campaign literature, press releases, schedules, and ephemera-most notably documenting such legislation and issues as: Anti-Semitism, Israel and the Holocaust, including Raoul Wallenberg; Human Rights issues, especially in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, China and Tibet, and the Middle East; the Department of Housing and Urban Development scandals; Animal Rights; Bay Area Rapid Transit and the San Francisco Airport; and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Tom Lantos papers are subdivided into six series: Personal Files, Campaign and Political Files, Office Files, Press Files, Constituent Service Files, and Legislative Files. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Bancroft Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Berkeley","addressRegion":"CA"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"University of California, Berkeley","location":{"addressLocality":"Berkeley","addressRegion":"CA"}}}}]}
