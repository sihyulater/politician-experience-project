Pease papers document the career of a journalist turned leader in state and national politics. The papers contain constituent correspondence, legislative files, reports, bills, campaign files, travel files, audio-visual material, and other files generated during Congressman Pease's service in the Ohio General Assembly (1964-66, 1968-76) and as a United States Representative from the 13th Ohio district (1977-92). Although the collection documents both his career in the Ohio General Assembly and his work in the U.S. Congress, the bulk centers on his eight terms in the U.S. Congress. The majority of the papers consist of the Congressman's Washington office files, covering virtually all aspects of his legislative, constituent service and public relations activities. District office files are modestly represented. The collection is organized into six major subgroups and thirty-four records series. The subgroups highlight major functional areas or activities: I. State House and Senate Records in Ohio, II. U.S. Congress Personal/Political Files; III. U.S. Congress Legislative Records; IV. U.S. Congress Constituent Service Records; V. U.S. Congress Press Relations/ Media Activities Records; and VI. Campaign Files (State and National). The collection is particularly strong in the areas of environment, human rights, labor, social issues, tax reform and trade. Several issues of local interest are highlighted in this collection as well, particularly files relating to Air Traffic Controllers. Many of those employed at the Federal Aviation Administration Control Center in Oberlin were fired during the Ronald Reagan administration. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Archives","location":{"addressLocality":"Oberlin","addressRegion":"OH"},"parentRecordLocation":{"name":"Oberlin College Library","location":{"addressLocality":"Oberlin","addressRegion":"OH"}}}}]}
