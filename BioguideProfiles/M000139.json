As a member of the Montana delegation of the U.S. House of Representatives his office maintained files in six basic groups:(Series 1) Organization and management of his Washington office; (Series 2) Summaries of his voting records and lists of bills he either sponsored or cosponsored; (Series 3) General correspondence files, including sequentially numbered correspondence from a wide spectrum of constituents related to numerous issues, concerns and requests, in particular related to bills he was sponsoring or cosponsoring; (Series 4) Legislative information, press releases, public relations and campaign materials in both print and electronic media; (Series 5) General legislative files of research papers and materials with editorial comments by Marlenee or his staff; draft bills in process and assorted amendments; position papers and staff memos; official government agency and industry reports and hand written notes from hearings and meetings; (Series 6) Files generated by Ron Marlenee's work on the Committee on Agriculture; (Series 7) Files generated by Ron Marlenee's work on the Interior and Insular Affairs committee. Many of the issues documented in series 5 through 7 appear in several places because of natural crossovers, therefore files have been alphabetically arranged by the dominant subject. Where possible the number, dates and/or title of the bills referred to in files are listed to further guide the researcher. A finding aid is available in the repository and online.","recordLocation":{"name":"Merrill G.
