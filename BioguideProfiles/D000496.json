Files from many of his cases as a partner of Lassiter and Drewry, Petersburg, Va. and Drewry and Old, Petersburg, Va. contain correspondence on claims settlement, veterans benefits, divorce cases, and real estate dealing. Of interest are letters regarding the 1906 murder trial of an indigent Negro. As Virginia state senator, 1912-20 Drewry served on the Virginia Governor Advisory Board on the Budget, the Virginia Association for Local Self Government, the Virginia State Auditing Committee, the Virginia Commission on Economy and Efficiency, the Virginia State Highway Commission, the Virginia Council of Defense, and the U.S. Committee on Public Information, Division of Four Minute Men. His papers reflect the interests of his constituents on prohibition and local option, Battlefield Park in Petersburg, better roads, women's suffrage, game laws, and post-office and scholarship appointments. His congressional papers deal almost entirely with patronage, appointments, and private claims.
