Waskey consist of photocopies of two diaries (1923-1925 and undated), two folders of other writings by Waskey, several photographs of Eskimo artifacts, a small number of reprints dealing with Alaskan archaeology and geology, and several newspaper clippings. The diaries include vivid accounts of Waskey's travels in Alaska. They reflect his interest in the Eskimo culture, language, and people, and his belief in their potential for economic success. Waskey's writings include some Eskimo stories, accounts of digging in the middens of old villages for pottery and ivory trinkets, and accounts of Waskey's search for markets for Alaskan products and materials. Little of the collection relates to Waskey's role as Alaska's Territorial delegate, but there is a telegram referring to his accomplishments in Congress, a list of people who attended a banquet in his honor, and a small amount of correspondence.", "recordLocation" : { "name" : "Alaska and Polar Regions Department, Elmer E.
