I am tracking the person's location throughout his life. Please generate a table of time and location. The time should be an inferred time period. The time period can be inferred based on the event described in the sentence, for example, attending a university usually takes 4 years, so you can infer that the person starts staying at the location 4 years prior to graduation.
